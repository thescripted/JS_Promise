## JS Promise Implementation

This is an (work-in-progress) implementation of Promises in JavaScript, following specification from [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/) while utilizing ES6 class syntax. This project is motivated by wanting to develop a deeper understanding of how JavaScript promises work under the hood.

This file uses [This Repository](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests) for Compliance Testing.

Inspired by this [Forbes Lindesay](https://www.promisejs.org/implementing/)
